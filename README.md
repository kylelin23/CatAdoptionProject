# Cat Adoption Project
# My project is an app created for first time cat adopters. It provides basic information such as when to feed your cat and what to do if they get lost, and runs with React Native. I used React Native so that the app can run on both iOS and Android. Some challenges I faced were the navigation and how to make it easy for the user to understand.
